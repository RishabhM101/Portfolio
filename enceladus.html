The primary objective of the orbiter is to establish a stable orbit around the moon, enabling a comprehensive assessment of its atmospheric and surface conditions. Equipped with a sample collection unit, the orbiter is designed to pass through the geysers, capturing gases and particulates emitted by the moon. Subsequently, these samples will undergo thorough analysis to detect potential signs of life.</p>
                 <p class="posts">Additionally, the satellite will have gradiometer to study the differentiation in Enceladus’s core. Complementing this, the lander carries a rover equipped with a seismometer, tasked with mapping the moon's internal structure. Furthermore, the rover conducts spectral analyses to understand the chemical composition of the surface.</p>
